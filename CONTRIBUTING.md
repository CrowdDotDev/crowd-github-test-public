- ## We develop with GitHub  
	- We use GitHub to host code, track issues and make feature requests. The official repository can be found on [https://github.com/CrowdDotDev/crowd.dev/](https://github.com/CrowdDotDev/crowd.dev/).  
- ## The pull request process  
	- Open a new Feature/Enhancement request or Bug report issue by selecting the corresponding  
	   type when creating an issue or commenting on an existing issue.  
	- Propose your plans and discuss them with the community on the issue  
	- Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.  
	- Make the changes described in the issue.  
	- Ensure that your code meets the quality standards.  
	- Submit your merge request!  
	- Usually, we merge using the following options:  
		- “Squash and merge ”  
		- “Delete head branch when pull request is merged”  
	- A member of the core team will review and merge your code.  
- ## Quality standards  
	- Backend code must have unit tests.  
	- JavaScript code must be compliant with ESLint and pass the Prettier formatting.  
	- Python code must be compliant with the black standard.  
	- In-code documentation is required for every function or class that is not self-evident.  
	- All new API endpoints that are relevant to the public API must have in-code documentation to generate OpenAPI specifications.  
	- The pipeline must pass.  
- ## Bug reports and feature requests  
	- We use GitHub to track public bugs and feature/enhancement requests.  
	- You can submit a new bug report or feature/enhancement request at [https://github.com/CrowdDotDev/crowd.dev/issues](https://github.com/CrowdDotDev/crowd.dev/issues) and select the appropriate template type.  
	- Please, be as specific as possible when submitting bug reports or feature/enhancement requests! 😃  
- ## Vulnerabilities  
	- If you have found a vulnerability in [crowd.dev](http://crowd.dev/) we would appreciate it if you would notify us via email at [joan@crowd.dev](mailto:joan@crowd.dev) instead of publicly as the vulnerability might need to be addressed first.
